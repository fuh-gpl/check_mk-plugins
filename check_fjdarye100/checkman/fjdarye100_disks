description:
 This check monitors the reported status of one of a physical disk
 in storage systems from Fujitsu which support the
 FJDARY-E100.MIB like the ETERNUS DX80 S2.
 This is an adaption of the corresponding fjdarye60 check.

item:
 The index of the device enclosure in the SNMP table. It is of type
 integer. The first module has an index of {0}.

inventory:
 The check supports automatic inventory. All available items which have
 a state other than {notavailable} (3) during the inventory run are added to the
 configuration. The {notavailable} state indicates that one disk is not installed.

[parameters]

 On all other states the check will report {CRITICAL}. Valid states are:
 {"available"}, {"broken"}, {"notavailable"}, {"notsupported"},{"present"},
 {"readying"}, {"recovering"}, {"partbroken"}, {"spare"}, {"formating"},
 {"unformated"}, {"notexist"}, {"copying"}.
