description:
 This check monitors the reported status of all installed channel
 adapters in storage systems from Fujitsu which support the
 FJDARY-E100.MIB like the ETERNUS DX80 S2.
 This is an adaption of the corresponding fjdarye60 check.

item:
 The index of the channel adapter in the SNMP table. It is of type
 integer. The first adapter has an index of {0}.

inventory:
 The check supports automatic inventory. All available items which have
 a state other than {invalid} (4) during the inventory run are added to the
 configuration. The {invalid} state is excluded because it means that some adapter
 is not installed.
