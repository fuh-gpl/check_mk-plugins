 This check needs the Check_MK {check_informix}-plugin installed on
 the agent. It also needs the waitmax-utility shipped with {check_mk}.
  
inventory:
  One separate check for each database found running will be created.

item: 
 The servername (INFORMIXSERVER) of the database.

examples:
 # Set global default values to 70 locks for
 # warning and 100 locks for critical
 informix_locks_default_levels = (70, 100)

perfdata:
 One value: The number of active locks.

[parameters]
warning(int): The number of active locks triggering a warning
critical(int): The number of active locks making the check critical

[configuration]

 for all checks which have no specific configuration. This is preset
