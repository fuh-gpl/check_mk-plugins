description:
 This check monitors the logical log usage of an IBM Informix database
 You can set warn/crit levels.

 This check needs the Check_MK {check_informix}-plugin installed on
 the agent. It also needs the waitmax-utility shipped with {check_mk}.
  
inventory:
  One separate check for each database found running will be created.

item: 
 The servername (INFORMIXSERVER) of the database.

examples:
 # Set global default values to 30% for
 # warning and 60% for critical
 informix_logusage_default_levels = (30.0, 60.0)

 # Set different levels for productive systems 
 # (having the host tag 'prod')
  check_parameters += [
    ( (20.0, 50.0), [ 'prod' ], ALL_HOSTS, [ "IDS .* logusage" ])
 ]

perfdata:
 Two values: The number of logfiles and the total size in bytes.

[parameters]
warning(float): Logusage WARN as a percentage (float) or in MB (int).
critical(float): Logusage CRIT level as a percentage (float) or in MB (int).

[configuration]
informix_logusage_default_levels(int/float, int/float): Global default 
 levels used for all checks which have no specific configuration.  
 Supported types (int / float). If this is a float, it is considered as
 percentage of the overall logspace. If it is an integer, it is
 considered to be MB of the overall logspace. If the used logspace reaches
 or exceeds on of these levels, the check will get into warning/critical state. 
 Default is {(30.0, 60.0)}.
