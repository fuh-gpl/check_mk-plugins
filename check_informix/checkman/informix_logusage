description:
 This check monitors the logical log usage of an IBM Informix database
 You can set warn/crit levels.

 This check needs the Check_MK {check_informix}-plugin installed on
 the agent. It also needs the waitmax-utility shipped with {check_mk}.
  
inventory:
  One separate check for each database found running will be created.

item: 
 The servername (INFORMIXSERVER) of the database.

examples:
 # Set global default values to 30% for
 # warning and 60% for critical
 informix_logusage_defaults = { "levels" : ( 30.0, 60.0 ) }

 # Set warning to 50% and CRIT to 80% for hosts tagged as prod-Servers.
 check_parameters += [
   ( { "levels" : (50.0, 80.0) }, [ 'prod' ], ALL_HOSTS, ["IDS .* logusage"] ),
 ]


perfdata:
 Two values: The number of logfiles and the total size in bytes.


[parameters]
parameters (dict):

 {"levels"}: A tuple containing the warn and crit levels for used logspace. 
 Supported types (int / float). If this is a float, it is considered as
 percentage of the overall logspace. If it is an integer, it is
 considered to be MB of the overall logspace. If the used logspace reaches
 or exceeds on of these levels, the check will get into warning/critical state. 
 Default is {(30.0, 60.0)}.


[configuration]
informix_logusage_defaults(dict): A dictionary with the optional keys mentioned in parameters.
