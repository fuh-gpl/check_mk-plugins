description:
 This check monitors the state of Informix dbspaces and chunks. It 
 checks the free space and the status of data- and mirrorfiles.

 This check needs the Check_MK {check_informix}-plugin installed on
 the agent.

inventory:
 One separate check will be created for each dbspace.

item: 
 A string composited of the servername (INFORMIXSERVER) and the 
 dbspace name, separated by a dot, for example {"ids_shm.rootdbs"}.

perfdata:
 Three values in bytes: size, the WARN level and the CRIT level.
 
examples:
 # Set levels for free space to 10% (WARN) and 5% (CRIT)
 informix_dbspaces_default_levels = ( 10.0, 5.0 )

[parameters]
warning(int/float): free space WARN level as a percentage (float) or in MB (int).
critical(int/float): free space CRIT level as a percentage (float) or in MB (int).

[configuration]
informix_dbspaces_default_levels(int/float, int/float): By default a 
 tuple containing the warn and crit levels for free space. Supported 
 types (int / float). If this is a float, it is considered as
 percentage of the size of the dbspace. If it is an integer, it is
 considered to be MB of free space. If the space drops to this level 
 or below, the check will get into warning state. Default is {(10.0, 5.0)}.
